There is no administrative charge for shares held for at least three years. Stockholders who wish to avail themselves of the share repurchase program must notify us by three business days before the end of the month for their shares to be repurchased by the third business day of the following month. The share repurchase program provides that share repurchases may be funded by (a) distribution reinvestment proceeds, (b) the prior or future sale of shares, (c) indebtedness, including a line of credit and traditional mortgage financing, and (d) asset sales.",
