It gives investors a low cost opportunity to include commercial real estate in an investment portfolio. Also, REITs avoid the “double taxation” treatment of income that would result from an investment in a corporation, because REITs do not pay taxes if certain standards are met, including the distribution of at least 90% of income that would otherwise be taxable. Hence, REITs are focused on generating and distributing income in the form of dividends to their shareholders.",

Other REITs that, like Modiv, are not listed on stock exchanges (so-called “non-traded” REITs), often raise investor capital through a commission-based distribution system that involves paid intermediaries such as broker-dealers and financial planners. The total commission and fee structure related to raising investor capital via this distribution channel is typically 10% of the overall offering proceeds. In other words, approximately 10% of the cost of the REIT shares is spent on commissions and related fees in these other non-traded REITs. Modiv.com does not pay commissions. Our method of distribution is the internet and our web site. Our goal is to attract qualified potential investors to www.Modiv.com utilizing print and on-line advertising, newspaper and magazine articles, blogs, and search engine optimization. We believe that with the ease of access to the internet and the transparency of the internet, Modiv.com can deliver a real estate product to the market that has 10% more of the investment amount actually being invested in real estate rather than being paid to others in the form of commissions. This is the primary way that we are unique and different.",

If you were able to purchase the same property for a lower price, say $800,000, then your cap rate would be 10% ($80,000 divided by $800,000 equals 10%).
